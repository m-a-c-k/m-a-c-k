#### Work Experience and Projects  
##### Software Engineer at Hiller Measurements - Austin, TX  
_Jun 2020- Present  
Software Development, Test, and Maintenance_   
- Responsibilities involve participating in the design, development, implementation, and verification of applications that interact with custom hardware
to run test systems. Participation in design reviews, customer meetings, the creation of specification documents, acceptance test plans, etc.
Extensive use of LabVIEW, Test Stand, C++  
##### Software Engineering Intern at Lifesize - Austin, TX  
_Aug 2019 - Dec 2019  
System Validation, debug, and automation efforts_  
- Responsibilities included support of the embedded software team in the testing, debug and validation of features of the various projects. I was tasked
with creating Python, Bash, and JavaScript scripts/programs that automated parts of the verification process. Worked with manufacturing engineers to
ensure each component of the device was being appropriately validated at each level of assembly.  

##### Hardware Engineering Intern at Lifesize Austin, TX
_Aug 2018 - Aug 2019  
Component Validation, HVT, debug._  
Support the verification and hardware teamâ€™s efforts in design verification,
debug, prototype, re-works, assembly, etc. Troubleshooting, BIOS configuration and other tasks.
Projects Senior Project - Trash Collecting, Autonomous Robot
I contributed to our teamâ€™s senior design project of an autonomous robot by creating much of
the motor driver logic to allow the robot to track detected objects, written in C++ and Python,
and the communication between the processing board, and motor controller board via SPI and
USB protocols, in C++ as well. OpenCV.
Thermal/PowerCycle Automation and Validation
Used Bash, Python, C, C++ to control peripheral devices, such as the thermal chamber and ac
switches, to support hardware validation efforts. Created multiple small visual windows applications in C/C-sharp to access previously created test scripts, control devices and log test data
Software/ Python, C++, Bash, Verilog, C/C(sharp), JavaScript, Node, VHDL, Jenkins,
Experience OS, Docker, Agile, Atlassian, JIRA, Agile
