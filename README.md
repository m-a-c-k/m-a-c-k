#### Work Experience and Projects  
_Software Engineer at Hiller Measurements - Austin, TX  
Jun 2020- Present  
Software Development, Test, and Maintenance_   
  - Responsibilities involve participating in the design, development, implementation, and verification of applications that interact with custom hardware
to run test systems. Participation in design reviews, customer meetings, the creation of specification documents, acceptance test plans, etc.
Extensive use of LabVIEW, Test Stand, C++  
  - Aug 2019 - Software Engineering Intern at Lifesize - Austin, TX  
Dec 2019 System Validation, debug, and automation efforts  
Responsibilities included support of the embedded software team in the testing, debug and validation of features of the various projects. I was tasked
with creating Python, Bash, and JavaScript scripts/programs that automated
parts of the verification process. Worked with manufacturing engineers to
ensure each component of the device was being appropriately validated at
each level of assembly.
Aug 2018 - Hardware Engineering Intern at Lifesize Austin, TX
Aug 2019 Component Validation, HVT, debug.
Support the verification and hardware team’s efforts in design verification,
debug, prototype, re-works, assembly, etc. Troubleshooting, BIOS configuration and other tasks.
Projects Senior Project - Trash Collecting, Autonomous Robot
I contributed to our team’s senior design project of an autonomous robot by creating much of
the motor driver logic to allow the robot to track detected objects, written in C++ and Python,
and the communication between the processing board, and motor controller board via SPI and
USB protocols, in C++ as well. OpenCV.
Thermal/PowerCycle Automation and Validation
Used Bash, Python, C, C++ to control peripheral devices, such as the thermal chamber and ac
switches, to support hardware validation efforts. Created multiple small visual windows applications in C/C-sharp to access previously created test scripts, control devices and log test data
Software/ Python, C++, Bash, Verilog, C/C(sharp), JavaScript, Node, VHDL, Jenkins,
Experience OS, Docker, Agile, Atlassian, JIRA, Agile
Education Bachelor of Science from Texas State University, San Marcos, TX
May 2020 Major: Electrical Engineering, Micro/Nano Device Systems
Ingram Engineering Scholarship - 2019/2020
Courses in: Electronics I and II | Linear Algebra | VLSI | Calculus I-III
